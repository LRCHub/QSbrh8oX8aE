(Antenna EP)

Saw kingdoms crushed and crumbled
Saw the earth from the rim of a ship
Heard the whistle of the damnation train
But I didn't see her coming

Baby clear sky light
That lyin' goat borrowed my heart
And now it's broke
With big guns booming like thunder
I should have struck him cemetery dead

41 dollars and 63 cents won't buy my way out of this mess
41 dollars and 63 cents won't get me a dress to compete with her best
God made woman when he took out a bone
Gave it to adam so he wasn't alone
Fell at his feet - a heap on the floor
Now he aint coming back no more

I saw him on the lake at Galilee
The ship was gliding away from me
Sails unfurled in the evening breeze
The white caps marbleized into peaks
The wind is a woman and the water is too
The moon he holds the reins of the tides
With big guns booming like thunder
I should have struck him cemetery dead
