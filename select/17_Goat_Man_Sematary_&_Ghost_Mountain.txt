Take me by the dead hand
Ghost Mountain, Sematary
Make me say that shit again (Huhh)

We been tweakin', up all night off the Red Bull
My piss is blood red just like the moon
The Goat Man comes around, your girl cry for you
I'ma stomp your fuckin' head with my fuckin' boots
Drag your body down, bury you behind the school
You been cryin', screamin', dyin', but you can't move
You know how it is, Goat Man needs a skinsuit

You can find me in the trees
